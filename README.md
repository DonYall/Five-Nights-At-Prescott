## Mohamed
On the leftmost camera, there is an option to play the audio. Use this toggle to increase or decrease the noise level so that it's not too loud or too quiet. If it is quiet for too long, Mohamed will kill you.
If, at any point, two or more extra sounds play at the same time, Mohamed will kill you.\
