# Instructions / Mechanics

## Monitor
Open the monitor by clicking it in the middle of the screen. Close it by pressing S or Esc. Click on the different available cameras to switch.

## Mohamed
On the leftmost camera, there is an option to change the audio volume. Use this toggle to increase or decrease the volume so that it's not too loud nor too quiet. If it is quiet for too long, Mohamed will kill you.
If, at any point, two or more extra sounds play at the same time, Mohamed will kill you.

## Hashir
Every hour, Hashir's alarm will ring but he won't wake up. React fast before the sound triggers Mohamed. Hashir sometimes appears in the room, hungry. Type "food?" with your keyboard to send him away.

## Danyal
Danyal will randomly appear in his camera playing games on his computer. If he rages, he will start screaming. In order to get him off his computer, cut the power with the switch near the left-center of the main room.

## Riyyan
Riyyan does not like sleeping in the cold. The place gets colder the longer the power is off. Make sure not to cool the place too much.

## Pramit
Pramit approaches you from the hallway, visible by the cameras. After reaching your door, he will attempt to kill you, but looking at him during a kill attempt will send him back to the hallway.
